## Add Couchbase Lite to your app

### Frameworks

#### iOS & tvOS

1. [Download Couchbase Lite](http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads#couchbase-mobile) for the platform your app is targeting.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Open the Couchbase Lite folder and drag **CouchbaseLite.framework** to the project navigator in Xcode.
4. In the **Choose options for adding these files** sheet, make sure that your app target is selected.

Couchbase Lite requires additional frameworks and libraries for building an app. These additional dependencies are added via Xcode build settings.

1. In the Xcode navigator, click on the project open the **Build Settings** tab.
2. Scroll to the **Linking** section, find the **Other Linker Flags** row and then add the flag **-ObjC** (be sure to use the capitalization shown).
3. Click the **Build Phases** tab.
4. Expand the **Link Binary With Libraries** section and add the following items.

    ```
    CFNetwork.framework
    Security.framework
    SystemConfiguration.framework
    libsqlite3.dylib
    libz.dylib
    libc++.dylib
    ```

	To use the SDK in Swift files, you must also import the framework in a bridging header (`#import <CouchbaseLite/CouchbaseLite.h>`).
		
#### macOS

For a macOS target, you'll need to make sure the framework is copied to your app's bundle. Follow the steps below.

1. [Download Couchbase Lite](http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads#couchbase-mobile) for the platform your app is targeting.
2. Open the **Build Settings** tab of your app target's settings.
3. In the **Linking** section, edit **Runpath Search Paths** and add `@loader_path/../Frameworks/`.
4. Now switch to the **Build Phases**.
5. Press the **Add Build Phase** button at the top of the window and create a new **Copy Files** phase.

6. Set the phase's destination to **Frameworks**.
7. Press the **+** button below the phases' file list and select **CouchbaseLite.framework** to add it.

#### Available frameworks

|Framework|Service|
|:--|:------|
|`CouchbaseLiteListener.framework`|To access the database through HTTP (often used for hybrid development and peer-to-peer sync). This component has a dependency on `JavaScriptCore.framework`, make sure to add this framework as well if you're planning on using it.|
|`CBLJSONValidator`|Validates JSON objects against JSON-Schema specs.|
|`CBLRegisterJSViewCompiler`, `libCBLJSViewCompiler.a`|To register Views and Filters through the Listener. When doing so, the logic is written in JavaScript and stored in the database.|
|`libCBLForestDBStorage.a`|To use ForestDB as the storage type.|
|`libsqlcipher.a`|To enable encryption on SQLite databases.|
|`Extras/CBLEncryptionController`|Utility class to handle password entry. Prompts the user to make up a key, asks for the key when re-opening the database, and asks again if the key was incorrect. It even takes advantage of Touch ID fingerprint authentication on recent iOS devices to avoid making the user deal with a password at all.|
|`Extras/CBLIncrementalStore`|A subclass of the NSIncrementalStore to allow Core Data to use a Couchbase Lite database as its persistent storage instead of the default SQLite database.|
|`Extras/CBLUICollectionSource`|A UICollectionView data source driven by a CBLLiveQuery.|

### Cocoapods

1. [Install Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
2. In your `Podfile`, add the following.

    ```ruby
    pod 'couchbase-lite-ios', '~> {{ site.package_version }}'
    ```

3. Install the pods and open the .xcworkspace file generated by Cocoapods.

    ```ruby
    pod install
    ```
    
    To use the SDK in Swift files, you must also import the framework in a bridging header (`#import <CouchbaseLite/CouchbaseLite.h>`).

    The following subspecs are available to import different Couchbase Lite components.

    |Pod|Service|
    |:--|:------|
    |`couchbase-lite-ios/SQLite`|To use SQLite as the storage type. This is the default.|
    |`couchbase-lite-ios/SQLCipher`|To use SQLCipher as the storage type.|
    |`couchbase-lite-ios/ForestDB`|To use ForestDB as the storage type.|

### Carthage

1. [Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)
2. Add `github "couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios" "release/{{ site.package_version }}"` to your Cartfile.
3. Run `carthage update --platform iOS`.
4. Drag `CouchbaseLite.framework` from the appropriate platform directory in `Carthage/Build/` to the **Embedded Binaries** section of your Xcode project's **General** settings.

## Getting Started

Create a new Xcode project and install Couchbase Lite by following one of the methods above.

<img src="../img/xcode-installation.png" class=center-image />


Open **ViewController.swift** in Xcode.

If you installed through Carthage, append 
```swift
import CouchbaseLite
```
in your import section

Then, add the following in the `viewDidLoad` method.

```swift
// Create a manager
let manager = CBLManager.sharedInstance()
// Create or open the database named app
let database = try! manager.databaseNamed("app")
// The properties that will be saved on the document
let properties = ["title": "Couchbase Mobile", "sdk": "iOS"]
// Create a new document
let document = database.createDocument()
// Save the document to the database
try! document.putProperties(properties)
// Log the document ID (generated by the database)
// and properties
print("Document ID :: \(document.documentID)")
print("Learning \(document.property(forKey: "sdk")!)")

// Create replicators to push & pull changes to & from Sync Gateway
let url = URL(string: "http://localhost:4984/hello")!
let push = database.createPushReplication(url)
let pull = database.createPullReplication(url)
push.continuous = true;
pull.continuous = true;

// Start replicators
push.start();
pull.start();
```

Build and run. You should see the document ID and property printed to the console. The document was successfully persisted to the database.

Before synchronizing documents to Sync Gateway you will need to disable App Transport Security. In the Xcode navigator, right-click on **Info.plist** and open it as a source file.

<img src="../img/info-plist.png" class=center-image />

Append the following inside of the `<dict>` XML tags to disable ATS.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key><true/>
</dict>
```

The application is now correctly configured to start synchronizing documents with Sync Gateway.

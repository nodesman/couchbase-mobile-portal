<block class="net" />

* ReplicationOptions -> ReplicatorConfiguration
* IReplication -> Replicator
* TLS support for replication (blips)

* CBLDatabaseOptions -> CBLDatabaseConfiguration
* New DocumentChangeNotification implementation
* CBLArray optimization
* New Replicator API with Online / Offline support
* LiveQuery support
* Minor changes to CBLDatabase and CBLDocument API including
  - CBLDatabase.compact()
  - CBLDatabase.count()
  - CBLDatabase.contains(id)
  - CBLDictionary.remove(key)

<block class="swift" />

* DatabaseOptions -> DatabaseConfiguration
* New DocumentChangeNotification implementation

  - DictionaryObject nil value support

<block class="net" />

- New APIs on Database such as `Count` and `Compact()`
- DatabaseOptions -> DatabaseConfiguration
- New native library delivery mechanism (transparent, but now requires `Activate` call on .NET and .NET Core via `Couchbase.Lite.Support.NetDesktop.Activate()`)

<block class="java" />

- New APIs on Database such as `count()`, `compact()` and contains(String id)
- New APIs on Dictionary such as `remove(String key)`

<block class="swift" />

- New unified API for Document, ReadOnlyDocument, DictionaryObject, ReadOnlyDictionaryObject, ArrayObject, ReadOnlyArrayObject.

- Fixed Swift replication delegate not functional (#1699)

<block class="net" />

- Replication! The new replicator is faster, but the protocol has changed, and the class API isn't yet finalized.  Also, unfortunately there is no public way to create replications yet but this will come soon.  
- Support automatic 1.x database upgrade to 2.0.  
- Various other optimizations under the hood.

<block class="java" />

- Blob
- Conflict Resolver

### Developer build 3

<block class="objc" />

- Cross platform Query API

<block class="swift" />

N/A

<block class="csharp" />

- Sub-document API
- Some taming of the dispatch queue model. (A database gets a queue and all the objects associated with it share the same one. Callback queue has been removed, and callbacks now come over the action queue so that it is safe to access the DB directly from the callback). Thread safety checking has been made optional (default OFF) and can be enabled in the DatabaseOptions class.

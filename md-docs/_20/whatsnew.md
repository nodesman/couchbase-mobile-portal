      Couchbase Mobile 2.0 is a groundbreaking new release for Couchbase Mobile. Weâ€™ve reimagined the developer experience with a cross-platform common core, new simplified API, and automated conflict resolution that can be customized. In this release, we are bringing N1QL queries and full-text search capabilities to mobile.

    This sample app allows users to search for flight and hotels, and subsequently to create a booking. The application then synchronizes documents with Sync Gateway 1.5 and Couchbase Server 5.0. Shared bucket access is enabled to allow web and mobile clients to perform the same operations on the bucket. It uses the Couchbase Lite 2.0 API that includes support for a N1QL like query interface and Full Text Search.
